Starting point

During the Summer School “Visualizing Open Access”, we were provided with the current research status of the Bundesländer-Atlas Open Access 2021. While knowledge on the situation of Open Access implementation at universities (Universitäten) is commonly in focus and widely research, little is known about Open Access at Universites of Applied Scienes and the Arts (Hochschulen). Our research question: What is the situation of Open Access at Hochschulen in Germany? 

Data collection and Curation

We filtered Hochschulen and generated a list of 222. Additional data on the institutions (private, public, church-owned) allowed us to filter for a final list of 190 publicly Hochschulen (as of 2021). This additional data was provided by research of the summer school organizers. 

Institutions implement Open Access based on a list of criteria. On our website, you can filter these criteria and see the percentage of Hochschulen which have implemented them on a map of Germany.
